        <p class="para"><span style="color: red;">Elon Reeve Musk</span> was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of 
            South Africa's capital cities. Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. Educated at the University of 
            Pennsylvania in physics, Musk started getting his feet wet as a serial tech entrepreneur with early successes 
            like Zip2 and X.com, which merged with a company that became PayPal. Elon Musk is the charismatic CEO of electric car 
            maker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He is a personal hero because he is innovative, curious, educated, motivated, 
            articulate, and funny. His Vision, and his companies, demonstrate many of the qualities making being human, human. 
            When I hear people talk about making America great again I point to Musk and say, â€œAmerica is already great".
